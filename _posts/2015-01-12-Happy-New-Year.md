First things, first! HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Now with that out of the way, I hope that this year starts off well for each and every one of you out there. To start the new year off on this blog I started back in November of last year I started out by doing some quick revamping of the site.
<!-- more -->
Yeah, I'm sure you have noticed. This blog's initial landing page had a list of my repositories. That is sort of gone, but not entirely. It is now easily available via the two GitHub badges off to the left hand side of the home page. The top one is for my own personal repositories, the one below that is for the organization I created, StormbotTCL. I've also added to the right hand side under the two badges, my Twitter feed. Feel free to use it to send me messages on Twitter, I will see them, so don't be shy about it. Now one last thing before I go talking about what you will see when you start reading a post such as this is that I've also added up in the header the GitHub link for StormbotTCL.

Now when you go into a post, such as this one, you will also noticed that I've turned on the ability to comment on the blog posts. I am using Disqus to power the comments for each blog post.

I will probably have more changes to come to this blog after I visit some other blogs that use Jekyll Bootstrap. Only time will tell what those will be and if I am able to figure out how to implement those changes.

Now, some changes that are outside the blog, itself. Starting today with this post, I am using Sublime Text 2 text editor with quite a few packages installed via the Package Control panel (which gives me an idea of what to post for my next post). I was using Notepad++, but with all the version control stuff that I do with my job (which uses SVN) and my own personal work (which uses Git), I just got tired of flipping back and forth from the text editor to the folder containing the file(s) I just edited to push an update. Now with Sublime Text 2, I can do the committing from the editor and in the cases where I need to run a update on the remote side (such as where I have the folder hosting this blog), that is just a window I have pushed off on to my secondary monitor.

Sublime Text 2 also has this nice feature where I can have customized layouts of all the files I could have open at one time AND having my file browser off to the left of the screen! To the right, I have a little snapshot of the file contents which I can use to scroll quickly through larger files. Syntax highlighting for the various languages (TCL, PHP, ColdFusion, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript) is also a plus.

That's all I have for now. I need to prepare myself for some TV shows that are about to air tonight!
