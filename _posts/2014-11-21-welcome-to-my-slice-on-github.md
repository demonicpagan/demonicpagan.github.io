Hello World! 

I feel that was an appropriate greeting for this first post considering it deals with 
the coming online of my GitHub page. This page I hope to post anything significant to any 
of my projects that I maintain. The main page I will be listing all my repositories. Just 
to make you aware. These repos are all that I have uploaded to GitHub. The e107 plugin I 
wrote and my FFXI WordPress plugin are no longer being maintained. I no longer make use 
of the e107 CMS and no longer play Final Fantasy XI.

<!-- more -->

If you like any of my projects, please free to fork the project. You are also welcome to 
assist me on projects that you use. Just send merge requests from the project you want to 
contribute to.

If you encounter any issues with any of my projects, please post the issue you are having on
the appropriate project issue page.

Until my next post whenever that may be.
