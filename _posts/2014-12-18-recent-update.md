It has been a few days since I have posted anything. I figured I would hit up on some changes I have made to some of my repositories. The first I would like to mention is one that deals with the Nova CMS put out by 
Anodyne-Productions. Presently in the works is version 3, but it is no where near ready for release. In the meantime, I write modifications (or MODS for short) for Nova 2. My most recent update was to my 
[Nova-UCIP-Stardate--Date--Time](https://github.com/demonicpagan/Nova-UCIP-Stardate--Date--Time) MOD. What I have added to this MOD is the ability to display in any theme the Stardate for Star Trek Online (STO). This
addition was made possible by the help of the person who maintains [STO Academy](http://www.stoacademy.com/).

My next update pertains to my work in progress for my Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) Wordpress Plugin. The point of this plugin is to allow you to display your FFXIV character information in your sidebar or on its own personal
page. I am using the API that Josh Freeman/Viion of XIVPads.com uses to scrape the FFXIV Lodestone. I have kept this up to date with the latest version of his API, I just haven't sat down to complete the plugin due to time
constraints with my job and family. (And I have to make time to play FFXIV, of course).

That is what has been happening for me on GitHub. If I don't happen to post anything within the next week, I wish everyone a Very Merry Christmas or Happy Holiday (take which ever your religion allows for) and I will throw in a
Happy New Year too, because frankly, I don't know when I'll be posting again.
